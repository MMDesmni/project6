One code is scraping from a local news website and getting and organizing the datas and saving them as csv
The other one is using the inner join method just to connect the tables to eachother and have a table that have actors they movies and the genres of the movies
The (scrapping) code is using the selenium library and scraping data from and even before adding them to csv file
We clean them we save them as variables so we could change them
The (movies) code is using the sqlalchemy library and using that with inner join query just to
Find the similarity(Foreign key) between these two so we could connect them
